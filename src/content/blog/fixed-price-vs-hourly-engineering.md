Most engineering firms bill hourly or fixed-price. Both have problems.

Pure hourly means invoices that never stop coming. Fixed-price sounds great until you need to change something and suddenly you're negotiating change orders for every minor decision.

Time and materials with actual transparency usually works better. Here's why.

## The Hourly Problem

When there's no structure around hourly billing, things spiral. I've seen projects quoted at "probably $50k" end up at $150k because nobody was tracking anything.

The incentives are wrong too. Firm makes more money when things take longer. Junior engineer takes 3x as long as a senior? That's 3x the revenue. There's no pressure to be efficient.

## The Fixed-Price Problem

Fixed pricing sounds like certainty. You know what you'll pay.

But engineering isn't construction. Things change. Requirements evolve. You discover better approaches mid-project. With fixed pricing, every adjustment becomes a scope negotiation. That friction hurts the project.

Firms also quote high to absorb risk. You're paying for their uncertainty. And if they underbid, corners get cut because they're losing money.

For something truly well-defined - work that's been done identically many times - fixed can work. Most real projects have unknowns.

## T&M Done Right

The better approach: time and materials with full visibility into where time goes.

You get a detailed estimate upfront, broken down by task. Every hour gets logged and categorized. You have access to the tracking tools. Weekly updates show burn rate vs. progress.

If something's running over, you know immediately. You discuss options instead of getting surprised by the invoice.

This requires trust, but the transparency makes trust verifiable. You can see the data.

## What Transparency Actually Looks Like

Real-time access to logged hours against specific tasks. No vague "administrative overhead" line items. No hidden project management fees. Every hour tied to actual deliverable work.

Proactive communication: "This subsystem is running 20% over - here's why and here are options." Not silence until the invoice shows up.

## The Incentive Question

People ask if T&M gives any incentive to be efficient. Yes:

Reputation. If you consistently blow estimates, nobody trusts your quotes anymore.

Repeat business. I want clients to come back. That only happens if they feel they got value.

Visibility. When hours are visible, you can't hide inefficiency.

Experience. Senior engineers are fast because they've done it before. Staffing with seniors means hitting estimates naturally.

## Choosing a Model

Pure hourly works for ongoing maintenance or true R&D where nobody knows the scope.

Fixed works for highly standardized work or clients who absolutely cannot exceed a budget.

T&M with transparency works for most development projects, especially when the relationship matters more than one transaction.

## Questions to Ask

What's actually in the quote? Detailed breakdown or lump sum?

How is time tracked? Monthly invoices aren't enough.

What happens when scope changes? Easy changes suggest confidence. Complicated change processes suggest they're protecting margin.

Can you see the project management tools? If not, why?

What's their track record on estimates vs. actuals? Anyone can give you numbers.

## Bottom Line

Pricing model matters less than trust. A good firm gives honest estimates, tracks time accurately, communicates when things change, and charges fairly.

Transparency makes trust verifiable. You see the data yourself instead of taking someone's word for it.
