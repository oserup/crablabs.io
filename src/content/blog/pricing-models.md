There's no universally "best" billing model. Each works well in specific situations and poorly in others. The right choice depends on how well-defined the work is, who should bear the risk, and what kind of relationship you want.

Here's an honest breakdown.

## The Three Models

**Hourly:** You pay for time spent. Simple, flexible, but unpredictable costs.

**Time & Materials (T&M):** You pay for time plus materials/expenses, usually with detailed tracking and estimates upfront. More structure than pure hourly.

**Fixed-Price:** You pay a set amount for defined deliverables. Predictable costs, but scope changes require negotiation.

## When Hourly Works

Hourly billing makes sense when:

- **Scope is genuinely unknown.** True R&D, exploratory prototyping, or debugging where nobody knows how long it'll take.
- **Work is ongoing and variable.** Maintenance, support, or advisory work without clear deliverables.
- **Tasks are small and discrete.** Quick consultations, code reviews, or one-off questions.

The problem with hourly is incentive alignment. The firm makes more money when work takes longer. A junior engineer taking 3x as long as a senior generates 3x the revenue. Without visibility into where time goes, costs spiral.

I've seen projects quoted at "probably $50k" end up at $150k because nobody was tracking anything.

## When T&M Works

T&M with transparency works when:

- **Requirements will evolve.** You know roughly what you want but expect to discover better approaches mid-project.
- **You want flexibility without surprises.** Detailed estimates upfront, real-time tracking, weekly burn rate updates.
- **The relationship is collaborative.** You're involved in decisions and trade-offs throughout.

Done right, T&M gives you visibility: every hour logged and categorized, access to tracking tools, proactive communication when something's running over. "This subsystem is at 80% of budget with 60% of work done--here are options."

The downside: it requires active client involvement. Some clients want to hand off a problem and get back a solution, not make ongoing decisions about scope trade-offs.

## When Fixed-Price Works

Fixed-price works when:

- **Scope is well-defined.** Clear requirements, known deliverables, minimal expected changes.
- **The firm has done similar work before.** Experience enables accurate estimation.
- **You need budget certainty.** Startups with fixed runway, grant-funded projects, or corporate budgets that can't flex.
- **You want accountability.** The firm is incentivized to be efficient because they absorb overruns.

The common criticism of fixed-price is scope rigidity. But that's a feature, not a bug. It forces both sides to think carefully about requirements upfront. If you can't define what you want, maybe the project isn't ready for development.

The real risk with fixed-price is on the firm. If they estimate poorly, they eat the cost. This means good firms quote carefully and say no to poorly-defined work. Bad firms either pad quotes excessively or cut corners when they underbid.

## Why We Use Fixed-Price

At Crab Labs, we primarily use fixed-price. Here's why:

**We can estimate accurately.** Our engineers have done similar work many times. A BLE sensor project, an industrial controller, a medical device firmware stack--we know how long these take because we've built them before.

**We staff with seniors.** Junior engineers are slower and less predictable. When your team is experienced, estimates are reliable. We don't need T&M flexibility because we rarely have surprises.

**Clients want certainty.** Most of our clients are startups or small companies with fixed budgets. They need to know what a project will cost, not track hours anxiously.

**It aligns incentives.** We make more money by being efficient, not by taking longer. If we finish early, we keep the margin. If we run over, we absorb it. That's skin in the game.

**It forces honest scoping.** When we bear the risk, we're motivated to push back on vague requirements and ensure scope is clear before starting. That discipline benefits everyone.

We do use T&M occasionally--for genuine R&D where nobody knows the scope, or for ongoing support relationships. But for defined projects, fixed-price works better for us and our clients.

## The Trust Question

Every model requires trust. The question is where and how.

**Hourly** requires trust that the firm is billing honestly and working efficiently.

**T&M** requires trust that estimates are reasonable and overruns are legitimate.

**Fixed-price** requires trust that the firm will deliver quality work, not cut corners to protect margin.

Transparency helps in all cases. Even with fixed-price, we explain how we arrived at the number, what's included, and what would trigger a change order. Clients can evaluate whether the estimate is reasonable.

## Questions to Ask Any Firm

Regardless of billing model:

**How did you arrive at this estimate?** Detailed breakdown or gut feel? Task-level estimates suggest experience.

**What happens if scope changes?** Easy changes suggest confidence. Rigid change processes suggest margin protection.

**What's your track record on estimates vs. actuals?** Past performance predicts future performance.

**Who's actually doing the work?** Senior engineers quoted, juniors delivered? That affects both quality and timeline.

**What's included and excluded?** Assumptions matter. "PCB layout" might mean different things to different firms.

## The Bottom Line

The "best" model depends on your situation:

- **Unknown scope, exploratory work:** Hourly or T&M
- **Evolving requirements, collaborative relationship:** T&M with transparency
- **Well-defined scope, need budget certainty:** Fixed-price
- **Ongoing support, no clear deliverables:** Hourly

What matters more than the model is whether the firm is honest, experienced, and aligned with your success. A good firm will recommend the model that fits your project, not the one that's most profitable for them.

We chose fixed-price because it fits how we work: experienced engineers, well-defined projects, and clients who value certainty. If your project is different--true R&D, unclear requirements, or ongoing support--we'll tell you, and we might suggest a different approach.

Honesty about fit matters more than winning the contract.
