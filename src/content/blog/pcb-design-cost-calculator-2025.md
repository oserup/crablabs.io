Hardware projects cost $25k-300k for 1000 units. Every project is different, but here's what typically drives costs and how to estimate yours.

## Project Cost Overview

| Complexity | Total Project Cost | What's Included |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| **Simple IoT device** | $25k-50k | Basic sensors, wireless, simple enclosure |
| **Industrial controller** | $60k-120k | Multiple I/O, protocols, compliance |
| **Medical device** | $125k-300k | Safety features, regulatory, extensive testing |

These numbers include design, components, fabrication, assembly, and testing for 1000 units.

## Real Project Costs

### IoT Temperature Sensor (1000 units)
WiFi, 2-year battery, plastic enclosure
- **US manufacturing:** $38k (9 weeks)
- **China manufacturing:** $32k (13 weeks)
- **Savings:** 16% (not the 60% they quoted)

### Industrial Controller (500 units)
Multiple I/O, Ethernet, metal enclosure
- **US manufacturing:** $85k (15 weeks)
- **Mexico manufacturing:** $65k (17 weeks)
- **Savings:** 24% (NAFTA benefits, easier communication)

**Reality check:** Offshore savings are real but lower than quoted. Budget for quality trips and communication delays.

## Where to Manufacture

**Volume drives the decision:**
- **Under 500 units:** Stay local. Setup costs kill offshore savings.
- **500-2,000 units:** Mexico or Eastern Europe. Good savings, easier communication.
- **Over 2,000 units:** China becomes worth it. Fixed costs spread over volume.

Chinese manufacturing needs $15k-25k in fixed costs. At $2-4 per unit savings, you need 4,000-8,000 units to break even.

## Project Cost Breakdown

Hardware projects have 5 main cost buckets:

| Cost Category | % of Total Project | Typical Cost (1000 units) |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------------|
| **Design** | 30-40% | $15k-75k |
| **Components** | 25-35% | $12k-100k |
| **Assembly** | 20-30% | $10k-70k |
| **Testing** | 5-15% | $3k-40k |
| **PCB Fabrication** | 5-10% | $3k-25k |

## Design (30-40% of total project)

Engineering rates vary widely ($100-300/hour depending on experience, location, and tooling). Design time depends on complexity and engineer efficiency:

| Project Type | Design Hours | Total Cost Range |
|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| **Basic IoT device** | 80-200 hours | $8k-60k |
| **Industrial controller** | 150-400 hours | $15k-120k |
| **Medical device** | 300-800 hours | $30k-240k |

**Factors affecting design time:**
- Engineer experience and tooling efficiency
- Requirements clarity and scope creep
- Component selection and availability
- Regulatory requirements and compliance needs

## PCB Fabrication (5-10% of total project)

Board costs depend on layers and volume. Simple 2-layer boards cost $3 each at 1000 units. Complex 8-layer boards cost $22 each.

**Cost multipliers that hurt:**
- Adding layers: 2→4 layers costs 3x more
- Fine features: <6mil traces add 30%
- Premium finishes: ENIG adds 20%

## Components (25-35% of total project)

ICs dominate the BOM cost. Microprocessors and power management chips typically cost 40-60% of your component budget.

**Lead time reality:**
- Stock components: Normal pricing
- 8+ week lead times: 20-50% premium
- Shortage/allocation: 2-5x normal price

Choose components with multiple sources and reasonable lead times.

## Assembly (20-30% of total project)

Assembly costs depend on component count and complexity:

| Project Complexity | Cost per Board (1000 units) |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Simple (45 components)** | $10/board |
| **Medium (160 components)** | $30/board |
| **Complex (280 components)** | $68/board |

BGAs and fine-pitch components cost more to place. Through-hole parts cost 5x more than SMT.

## Testing (5-15% of total project)

Testing costs are often underestimated:

**Essential testing:**
- Functional test: $10k-20k total for 1000 units
- Environmental test: $5k-12k (temperature, humidity)
- EMC pre-compliance: $8k-15k (saves money vs. failing formal tests)

**Prototype iterations:** Budget $30k-80k total for proof-of-concept through pilot run. Each iteration takes 3-6 weeks.

## Quick Cost Estimate

**Rough formula:**
Design cost ≈ (PCB layers × $500) + (component count × $15) + complexity factor

**Complexity factors:**
- Simple digital: 1.0x
- Mixed signal: 1.3x
- High-speed: 1.6x
- Medical: 2.0x

**Example design cost calculations:**
- Consumer IoT (4L, 150 components): $3k-12k design cost
- Medical device (6L, 250 components): $8k-32k design cost
- Industrial (4L, 200 components): $4k-15k design cost

Wide ranges reflect differences in engineer rates, efficiency, and project complexity. Multiply by 2-5x for total project cost.

## Common Mistakes That Blow Budgets

| Mistake | Cost Impact | How to Avoid |
|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Component selection by price only** | 50-100% overrun | Check availability, lead times, alternates |
| **No iteration budget** | 25-50% overrun | Plan for 2-3 prototype rounds |
| **Rushing design phase** | 200%+ overrun | Proper requirements, design reviews |
| **Offshore "savings" assumptions** | 30-50% overrun | Factor hidden costs, quality trips |

## Manufacturing Location Decision

| Your Situation | Best Choice | Why |
|----------------|-------------|-----|
| **<500 units, tight timeline** | US/Local | Setup costs kill offshore savings |
| **500-2k units, cost-sensitive** | Mexico/Europe | Good savings, easier communication |
| **>2k units, cost-critical** | China/Asia | Volume justifies fixed costs |
| **Regulatory/IP-sensitive** | US/Local | Compliance and protection easier |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

| Strategy | Potential Savings | Implementation |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Standard packages only** | 15-30% assembly | Avoid exotic packages, stick to 0603/0805 |
| **Single assembly process** | 10-20% assembly | All SMT or all through-hole, not mixed |
| **Design for test** | 20-40% testing | Include test points, boundary scan |
| **Volume planning** | 20-40% total | Combine multiple products in one run |

## Budget Planning

| Budget Category | Add This Buffer | Why |
|----------------|-----------------|-----|
| **Design iterations** | +25% | First design rarely works perfectly |
| **Manufacturing delays** | +15% | Component shortages, fab delays |
| **Testing and rework** | +10% | Debug time, ECO changes |

**Reality check:** A $15k design that works beats an $8k design that needs $20k in fixes.

**Disclaimer:** All costs are industry averages based on 2024 data. Every project is different - actual costs vary significantly based on specific requirements, supplier relationships, market conditions, component availability, and unique project constraints. Regional costs vary 20-60% depending on location and quality requirements.
