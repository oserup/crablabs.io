Who we are: 
- Crab Labs
- Founded 2024
- We were tired of seeing engineering firms charge large fees for poor quality work and wanted to make quality work available for more people

What we do:
- Design and Develop Circuits and Electronic Hardware
    - Analog Circuits
    - Digital Circuits
    - Mixed Signal Systems  
- Design and Develop Custom Firmware and Supporting Software/Firmware for the Electronics
    - In C and Rust
    - Using Python for scripting and testing and such
    - For mainly ARM and Risc-V processors

Who we do it for (in order of prominence)
- Biomedical Devices
- Insutrial/Robotics
- Scientific Instruments
- Consumer Electronics

What Differentiates Us?
- We provide direct access to our engineers
- We spend lots of time upfront defining our goals, approach, as well as the design as to generate better results faster
- Extensive and complete documentation standard
- We design for cost, reliability, manufacturability, maintainaability, and testability from day one
- Our designs are meant to be easy to mofiy in the future
- Our team is tightly integrated so the electronics come out great and optimized (better than using a HW and then FW firm)
- Robust and comprehensive testing setup
