## Featured Case Studies

### Medical

**Ultrasound Positioning Controller** (6 months)
5-axis motor controller for medical imaging. Replaced a failed design from another firm. Consolidated five driver boards onto a single 6-layer PCB with USB-C interface. Motion control firmware with trapezoidal velocity profiling. Result: +/-0.1mm accuracy, passed IEC 60601 pre-compliance first attempt, 3x smaller and 10x cheaper than original.
Platform: TI C2000

**Neonatal Biomarker Patch** (4 months)
Rechargeable wearable for long-term neonatal monitoring. Ultra-compact multi-sensor front-end with analog signal conditioning, digital filtering, and BLE transmission. Optimized power tree and sleep states for extended battery life. Used successfully in client's investigational pilot study.
Platform: Nordic nRF54

### Industrial

**Intelligent PDU Controller** (11 months)
Smart monitoring platform for datacenter power distribution. Linux SOM + STM32 architecture with 13" touchscreen UI. Implemented Modbus RTU/TCP, SNMP, BACnet, and HTTPS REST API. Added ground fault monitoring, temperature sensing, and digital inputs. Deployed in datacenters and commercial buildings.
Platform: Linux SOM + STM32

**GaN BLDC Motor Controller** (6 months)
4kW brushless motor driver for robotics. GaN power stage with 100kHz switching (5x faster than predecessor). 4-layer copper-heavy stackup with thermal vias for heat management. Field-oriented control with 40kHz current loop. Achieved higher efficiency and lower acoustic noise in compact form factor.
Platform: GaN + STM32G4

### Scientific

**Gravimeter Modernization** (4 months)
Digital retrofit for LaCoste-Romberg gravity meters (precision instruments worth $50k+ with no manufacturer support). Two-part system: internal module with 24-bit ADC and OLED display, external logger with GPS tagging, WiFi, and BLE. Gave new life to instruments that would otherwise be scrapped.
Platform: STM32L4 + ESP32

**Aeroponics Research Platform** (4 months)
Precision atomization system for ag-tech startup. Custom ultrasonic atomizer drivers with closed-loop flow control. Achieved 99%+ flow stability. Enabled client to file patents and establish university research partnerships.
Platform: nRF52840

## Differentiators
- **No Middlemen:** You speak directly to the engineer doing the work.
- **In-House Lab:** We own our test equipment (up to 8 GHz), allowing faster iteration than outsourcing to test houses.
- **IP Ownership:** Clients own 100% of the design files, firmware source code, and documentation upon delivery.
- **Compliance Experience:** Design experience with FCC, CE, and medical device (IEC 60601) requirements.
