# Client Perspective Review: Crab Labs Homepage

**Reviewer Profile:** VP of Engineering, Mid-Size Biomedical Device Company
**Company:** 200 employees, $50M revenue
**Experience:** 20+ years in medical device development
**Current Need:** FDA Class II device development partner
**Review Date:** February 2026

## Executive Summary

The homepage gives me a clearer picture of what Crab Labs does than the About page. The pricing transparency is refreshing, and the industry-specific compliance badges (FDA 510(k), IEC 60601, IEC 62304, ISO 13485) tell me they understand my world. However, I still have questions about their depth of experience and capacity.

**Bottom Line:** This would get them on my "worth a conversation" list, but I'd need answers before recommending to my board.

## First Scan (30 Seconds)

### What I See Immediately

**Positive:**
- "Medical & Industrial electronics" — Good, they're not trying to be everything
- "$150/hr" — Competitive rate, much lower than big firms
- "FDA 510(k)" badge — They know the term, at least
- "Book a call" — Easy next step

**Concerning:**
- No team size mentioned on homepage
- No case studies or project examples
- Only one testimonial, and it's not from medical

**My Initial Question:** "How many 510(k) submissions have they actually supported?"

## Section-by-Section Assessment

### Hero Section

> "Medical & Industrial electronics."
> "Hardware. Firmware. Testing. From concept to production."

**My Reaction:** Generic. Every electronics consultancy says this. What makes you different from the 50 other firms I could call?

> "No middlemen. Fixed pricing. You own the IP."

**Better.** These are concrete claims I can verify. Fixed pricing is attractive because cost overruns are my biggest headache with consultancies.

### Services Section

**What Caught My Eye:**
- "Product Development — from $10k"
- "Testing & Compliance — from $2.5k"

**My Questions:**
1. "$10k" is the minimum — what's a realistic range for a Class II device? $50k? $200k? I need to know if we're in the same ballpark.
2. "Testing & Compliance" — what exactly can they test? EMC? Biocompatibility? Electrical safety? The "pre-certification testing in our lab" is vague.
3. "Design Review — from $1k" — Actually useful. I might start here to evaluate their competency before committing to a larger project.

**Missing:**
- Typical project duration
- What deliverables look like
- Example project scopes

### Industries Section

**Medical Card:**
> "Class I–III medical devices. Patient monitors, diagnostics, and wearables."
> Badges: FDA 510(k), IEC 60601, IEC 62304, ISO 13485

**My Reaction:** The right keywords are here. They mention IEC 62304 which suggests they understand software lifecycle for medical devices. ISO 13485 badge is interesting — do they have a QMS, or just experience working with clients who do?

**What I Need to Know:**
1. How many 510(k) submissions have they supported?
2. What classes of devices? (Class I is trivial; Class III is serious)
3. Do they handle DHF/DMR documentation?
4. What's their software process for IEC 62304 compliance?

**Concern:** The card says "Patient monitors, diagnostics, and wearables" — these are very different device types. A wearable fitness tracker is nothing like a Class II patient monitor. This feels like they're casting a wide net.

### Pricing Section

**What I Appreciate:**
- Transparency. Most consultancies hide pricing behind "contact us."
- $150/hr is competitive. My usual firms charge $200-350.
- Startup discount at $135/hr — we're not a startup, but it shows flexibility.

**What Concerns Me:**
- "Fixed price — Set scope, set price." — How do they handle scope changes? Every project has scope creep. Do they nickel-and-dime on change orders?
- No indication of project minimums beyond service tiers
- Materials at "cost + 10%" is fair, but what's their procurement capability?

**My Question:** "What does a typical medical device development project cost? Give me a range."

### What Makes Us Different Section

**Relevant Points:**
- "In-house test lab — Pre-compliance testing on-site" — This is genuinely valuable. Most consultancies outsource testing, which adds weeks.
- "You own everything — 100% IP ownership from day one" — Standard for consultancies, but good to state explicitly.

**Missing:**
- Team credentials and backgrounds
- Quality system / process information
- Insurance / liability coverage

### Testimonial Section

**The Quote:**
> "Crab Labs played a key role in refining and validating our product development. We couldn't have done it without them."
> — Myles Ainley, CEO at Atmos Research & Development

**My Reaction:**
- One testimonial is not enough
- It's not from a medical device company
- The quote is generic — "refining and validating" could mean anything
- I've never heard of Atmos Research & Development

**What I Need:**
- A testimonial from a medical device company
- Specific outcomes: "Passed EMC on first submission" or "Completed 510(k) in 8 months"
- Someone I can actually call for a reference

## Questions I'd Ask on a Discovery Call

### Technical Capability
1. Walk me through a recent Class II medical device project. What was the device, what did you do, what was the outcome?
2. How do you handle IEC 62304 software documentation? Do you produce the SRS, SDS, architecture docs?
3. What's your design review process? Do you do formal reviews per 21 CFR 820?
4. Your lab does EMC pre-compliance — what about electrical safety testing (IEC 60601-1)?

### Quality & Compliance
5. Do you have a quality management system? ISO 13485 certified?
6. How do you handle design history files? Do we own the DHF or do you maintain it?
7. What's your configuration management approach for medical device projects?

### Business & Logistics
8. What's your current capacity? Can you dedicate 2-3 FTE to a 12-month project?
9. What happens if a key engineer leaves mid-project?
10. Do you carry E&O insurance? What's your coverage?
11. How do you handle NDAs and conflict of interest? (Will you work for my competitor?)

### Project Specifics
12. What would a Class II device development cost? Ballpark?
13. What's your typical timeline for a 510(k)-ready design?
14. Do you help with regulatory submission, or just engineering?
