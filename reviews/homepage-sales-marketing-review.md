# Sales & Marketing Review: Homepage

**Reviewer:** B2B Marketing Executive Analysis
**Page:** `/` (Homepage)
**Date:** 2026-02-01
**Overall Assessment:** Strong foundation with clear positioning, but underselling key differentiators and missing social proof.

**Conversion Impact Score: 6.5/10**

---

## Executive Summary

The homepage does many things right: clear positioning ("Medical & Industrial electronics"), transparent pricing, and logical information flow. However, it leaves significant conversion value on the table by underselling the automated lab capability, having weak social proof (single testimonial), and not clearly differentiating from competitors in the hero.

---

## Pass 1: First Impression (5-Second Test)

### What a Visitor Sees Immediately

**Positive:**
- "Medical & Industrial electronics" — Clear industry focus
- "Book a call" CTA — Obvious next step
- Dark, professional aesthetic — Suggests serious engineering

**Concerning:**
- "Hardware. Firmware. Testing." — Generic tagline
- No social proof visible above the fold
- No indication of company size or credentials

**5-Second Verdict:** "This is an electronics consultancy focused on medical and industrial. They want me to book a call."

**What's Missing:** Why should I pick them over competitors? What makes them special?

---

## Pass 2: Messaging Analysis

### Hero Section

**Current:**
> "Medical & Industrial electronics."
> "Hardware. Firmware. Testing. From concept to production."
> "No middlemen. Fixed pricing. You own the IP."

**Analysis:**
- The headline is clear but not compelling
- The subhead is generic — any electronics consultancy could say this
- The differentiators line is good but buried

**Suggested Improvement:**
Lead with the most differentiating element. Consider:
> "Medical & Industrial electronics."
> "Direct access to senior engineers. Fixed pricing. You own everything."
> "Hardware, firmware, and compliance testing from a team that ships."

---

### Services Section

**What Works:**
- Clear pricing transparency ("from $10k", "from $1k")
- Four distinct service tiers
- Links to detailed service pages

**What's Hurting Conversion:**
1. **No outcome-based messaging** — "Circuit design, board layout..." describes activities, not results
2. **Price anchoring is weak** — "$10k" could mean anything; no context for value
3. **Team Augmentation is buried** — If this is a common entry point, it should be positioned differently

**Suggested Service Descriptions:**
- Product Development: "From idea to manufacturing-ready design. We handle the engineering so you can focus on the business."
- Design Review: "Catch problems before they cost you. Our engineers review your existing design and tell you what to fix."

---

### Industries Section

**What Works:**
- Color-coded cards are visually distinct
- Compliance badges build credibility
- Specific standards mentioned (FDA 510(k), IEC 60601)

**What's Hurting Conversion:**
1. **Order doesn't match priority** — Medical is 42% of business but shown last
2. **No case study links** — Cards should link to relevant examples
3. **Generic descriptions** — "Motor controllers, robotics, sensors" tells me nothing about YOUR capabilities

**Suggested Improvement:**
Add specificity: "We've helped 15+ medical device startups pass FDA 510(k) on first submission" (if true).

---

### Pricing Section

**What Works:**
- Transparent hourly rates — Rare for consultancies
- Multiple billing options explained
- Rate card is clear and scannable

**What's Hurting Conversion:**
1. **No value context** — $150/hr compared to what? Big firms charge $300+
2. **Fixed pricing undersold** — The "we absorb overruns" message from About page isn't here
3. **No project examples** — "From $10k" means nothing without context

**Suggested Improvement:**
Add value framing: "Most consultancies charge $200-400/hr for junior engineers with PM overhead. We're $150/hr for direct senior engineer access."

---

### What Makes Us Different Section

**What Works:**
- Four clear differentiators
- Concise explanations
- Consistent visual treatment

**What's Hurting Conversion:**
1. **Repeats hero messaging** — "No middlemen" appears in both places
2. **Lab capability is undersold** — "In-house test lab" should be a major selling point
3. **Generic section title** — "What makes us different" is corporate-speak

**The Lab Opportunity:**
The in-house automated testing lab is a HUGE differentiator. Most consultancies outsource this. This should be a featured section, not a bullet point. Consider:

> "Test before you ship."
> "Our automated lab runs overnight. EMC pre-scans, environmental testing, functional validation. Find problems before the certification test, not during."

---

### Insights Section

**What Works:**
- Shows thought leadership
- Regular content publishing signals active company
- Clean card layout

**What's Hurting Conversion:**
1. **No relevance filtering** — Should show posts relevant to visitor's industry
2. **Generic section title** — "Latest articles" vs "Engineering insights" or similar
3. **No engagement metrics** — Read time, view count, etc.

---

### Testimonial Section

**Critical Problem: Only One Testimonial (Again)**

This is the same issue as the About page. One testimonial from one company is not social proof — it's a single data point.

**What's Needed:**
- 3-5 testimonials from different industries
- Client logos (even if testimonials aren't available)
- Specific outcomes: "Passed EMC on first try" / "Shipped 3 months ahead of schedule"

---

## Pass 3: Conversion Path Analysis

### Primary Conversion Paths

1. **Book a call** (Hero CTA) — Strong placement
2. **Send project details** (Hero secondary) — Good alternative
3. **Get a quote** (Pricing section) — Logical placement
4. **Get in touch** (Differentiators section) — Appropriate

### Missing Conversion Opportunities

1. **No CTA after Industries** — Visitor who identifies with an industry has no next step
2. **No CTA after Insights** — Engaged reader should be prompted
3. **No CTA after Testimonial** — Peak trust moment with no action

### Friction Points

1. **No indication of response time** — "Book a call" but when? How soon?
2. **No preview of the call experience** — "20 minutes with an engineer, not a salesperson"
3. **No urgency elements** — Capacity indicators, availability, etc.

## Competitive Positioning

### What Crab Labs Claims

1. No middlemen / Direct engineer access
2. Fixed pricing
3. Full IP ownership
4. In-house lab
5. 30-day support

### What Competitors Typically Claim

1. Expert engineers
2. Fast turnaround
3. Quality work
4. Industry experience

### Differentiation Gap

Crab Labs has REAL differentiators (lab, pricing model, direct access) but presents them at the same level as generic claims. The messaging doesn't emphasize what's truly unique.

**Recommendation:** Lead with the automated lab and fixed pricing model. These are concrete, verifiable differentiators that competitors can't easily match.

## Page Flow Optimization

### Current Flow
Hero → Services → Industries → Pricing → Differentiators → Insights → Testimonial

### Suggested Flow (for conversion)
Hero → Social Proof (logos) → Services → Industries → Pricing → Differentiators (Lab Featured) → Testimonials → Insights → Final CTA

**Key Changes:**
1. Add logo bar early for credibility
2. Feature the lab as standalone section
3. Move testimonials before insights (trust before thought leadership)
4. Add final CTA section before footer

---

## Specific Copy Recommendations

### Hero Subhead
**Current:** "Hardware. Firmware. Testing. From concept to production."
**Suggested:** "Senior engineers. Fixed pricing. From concept to production."

### Services Intro
**Current:** "End-to-end product development. Design, build, test, ship."
**Suggested:** "From first prototype to manufacturing handoff. One team, start to finish."

### Differentiators Section Title
**Current:** "What makes us different"
**Suggested:** "How we work" or "Our approach"

### In-House Lab Card
**Current:** "Pre-compliance testing on-site. Find issues before the official test."
**Suggested:** "EMC, environmental, and functional testing in our automated lab. Fix problems before they cost you."

## Priority Action Items

### High Priority (This Week)
1. **Add client logos** — Even 4-5 logos dramatically increase credibility
2. **Add CTA after testimonial section** — Convert at peak trust
3. **Strengthen lab messaging** — Expand to featured differentiator

### Medium Priority (This Month)
4. **Add more testimonials** — At least 3, ideally one per industry
5. **Reorder Industries** — Medical first (42% of business)
6. **Add project count or metrics** — Concrete numbers build trust

### Lower Priority (This Quarter)
7. **A/B test hero messaging** — Test differentiators-first approach
8. **Add case study previews to Industry cards**
9. **Implement urgency/availability indicators**

---

## Metrics to Track

1. **Hero CTA click-through rate** — Primary conversion metric
2. **Time to first CTA interaction** — Are people engaging quickly?
3. **Scroll depth** — Are people reaching testimonial section?
4. **Quote form submissions** — Secondary conversion
5. **Cal.com booking completions** — Final conversion

---

## Final Assessment

The homepage has solid bones but isn't converting at its potential. The main issues:

1. **Undersold differentiators** — The lab and pricing model are unique but buried
2. **Weak social proof** — Single testimonial, no logos, no metrics
3. **Generic messaging** — Sounds like any consultancy in the hero
4. **Missing CTAs** — Several sections end without prompting action

**Score Breakdown:**
- Clarity: 8/10 — Message is clear, just not compelling
- Trust: 5/10 — Minimal social proof
- Differentiation: 6/10 — Has it but undersells it
- Conversion optimization: 6/10 — Good CTAs but missing opportunities
- Overall: 6.5/10

**Bottom Line:** This homepage gets the job done but leaves money on the table. With better social proof and elevated differentiator messaging, it could move from "acceptable" to "compelling."
