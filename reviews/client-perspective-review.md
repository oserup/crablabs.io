## Executive Summary

As someone who has worked with over a dozen engineering consultancies over my career, I have strong opinions about what works and what does not. This review evaluates Crab Labs from the perspective of a potential client with a real project and real budget at stake.

**Bottom Line:** Interesting positioning, but significant gaps that would require a conversation before I could recommend them to my board.

## Pass 1: First Impressions (30-second scan)

### What I Notice Immediately

**Positives:**
- "5 senior engineers, 30+ years combined" - concrete numbers, not vague claims
- "No salespeople, no project managers" - they understand this is a differentiator for buyers like me
- "100% Your IP" - addresses a real concern
- "0 Project Managers" highlighted prominently - bold positioning

**Concerns:**
- 30+ years across 5 engineers averages to 6 years each. That is not "senior" in my world. My senior engineers have 15+ years individually.
- "Engineers who build what others can't" - This is marketing speak. Everyone says this.
- Founded 2024 - They are brand new. Two years in business.
- Only ONE testimonial, from a CEO at "Atmos Research & Development" - I have never heard of them

**Gut Reaction:** Skeptical but intrigued. The no-PM angle is refreshing. But they are young, small, and I need more proof.

## Pass 2: Deep Dive - Does This Address My Concerns?

### Concern 1: Can they handle FDA Class II?

**What the page says:**
- "Medical Devices: 42%" of their work
- Equipment list includes EMC test gear
- Lab section mentions "EMC pre-compliance"

**What I need to see:**
- How many 510(k) submissions have they supported?
- Do they understand DHF/DMR requirements?
- IEC 62304 compliance experience?
- Do they have a quality system (ISO 13485)?

**Verdict:** **INSUFFICIENT.** The page gives percentages but no specifics. 42% of what volume? If they did 5 projects total, that is 2 medical projects. Not enough for my comfort level.

### Concern 2: Do they understand risk and documentation?

**What the page says:**
- Nothing directly about risk management
- Nothing about documentation practices
- No mention of design controls

**What I need to see:**
- Understanding of IEC 14971 risk management
- Design review process
- How they handle design history files
- Traceability approach

**Verdict:** **RED FLAG.** A medical device consultancy that does not mention design controls or risk management on their About page either (a) does not understand our world, or (b) understands it but does not think it matters for marketing. Neither is great.

### Concern 3: Are they professional enough for board approval?

**What the page says:**
- Long Beach, CA address (verifiable)
- Named testimonial from a real person (can be verified)
- Professional but minimal design
- Cal.com booking link (lightweight scheduling)

**What raises eyebrows:**
- No team photos or bios
- No named engineers
- No LinkedIn profiles
- No certifications or credentials listed
- No insurance/bonding information

**Verdict:** **MIXED.** The website is professional enough, but I cannot evaluate the team. For a $50k+ project, I need to know who is doing the work.

### Concern 4: What happens if things go wrong?

**What the page says:**
- "Fixed Pricing - We absorb overruns, not you"

**What I need to see:**
- How are scope changes handled?
- What is the change order process?
- What are payment terms?
- What happens if we are unhappy with deliverables?
- Warranty terms?

**Verdict:** **INSUFFICIENT.** Fixed pricing is appealing, but the details matter. Every consultancy claims fixed pricing until something changes.

## Pass 3: Comparison to Other Consultancies

### How Crab Labs Compares

| Criteria | Large Firm (Battelle, etc.) | Mid-Size Specialist | Crab Labs |
|----------|---------------------------|---------------------|-----------|
| FDA Experience | Extensive, documented | Moderate, case studies | Claims 42%, no details |
| Team Visibility | Full profiles | Key leads visible | Anonymous |
| Quality System | ISO 13485 certified | Often certified | Unknown |
| Capacity | Scales easily | Limited | Very limited (5 people) |
| PM Overhead | High (15-25%) | Moderate | Claims zero |
| Hourly Rate | $200-400/hr | $150-250/hr | $150/hr |
| Responsiveness | Slow | Moderate | Unknown (claims "direct") |

### Positioning Analysis

Crab Labs is trying to be the "anti-consultancy consultancy" - small, direct, no overhead. This appeals to me in theory. I have been burned by firms that charge $300/hr while junior engineers do the work and I talk to project managers who cannot answer technical questions.

But their positioning creates its own problems:
- **No redundancy:** If a key person gets sick or leaves, what happens to my project?
- **No depth:** Can they handle a multi-disciplinary project that needs mechanical, software, and hardware?
- **No institutional knowledge:** Two years of operation means limited process maturity

## What Would Make Me Pick Up the Phone

1. **Specific FDA experience:** "Supported 3 successful 510(k) submissions for Class II devices" with details
2. **Named engineers with backgrounds:** Let me verify their experience on LinkedIn
3. **ISO 13485 certification** or at minimum a quality system description
4. **Client references I can call:** Not just a testimonial, but "Contact this person"
5. **A medical device case study with real detail:** Not "Passed IEC 60601" but specifics about test failures, iterations, documentation approach

---

## What Might Make Me Pass

1. **Lack of scale:** My project needs 2-3 full-time equivalent engineers for 12 months. Can 5 people handle this while serving other clients?
2. **No visible QMS:** For a Class II device, I need documentation that holds up to FDA scrutiny
3. **Unknown team:** I am betting my project on people I cannot evaluate
4. **Young company:** Two years of history is thin. What happens if they dissolve mid-project?
5. **Single testimonial:** One quote from one company in one industry is not enough social proof

---

## Questions I Still Have After Reading This Page

### Technical Capability
1. What EDA tools do they use? (Important for file compatibility)
2. Do they do mechanical design, or just electronics?
3. What is their firmware development process? MISRA? Static analysis?
4. Do they have experience with wireless medical devices (FDA cyber guidance)?

### Business/Process
1. What is their capacity? How many projects can they handle simultaneously?
2. What is their typical lead time?
3. Do they carry professional liability insurance? E&O?
4. What is their conflict of interest policy? (Will they work for my competitor?)
5. What does "30 days support included" actually mean?

### Quality/Compliance
1. Do they have a quality management system?
2. How do they handle design controls for medical projects?
3. What is their document control process?
4. Who owns the design history file at end of project?

### Team
1. Who are the five engineers?
2. What are their backgrounds?
3. Which industries did their experience come from?
4. Who would be assigned to my project?

## Detailed Section-by-Section Feedback

### Hero Section

> "Engineers who build what others can't."

This is generic. Every boutique consultancy says something similar. It tells me nothing about their actual capabilities.

> "Five senior engineers. One lab in Long Beach. No salespeople, no project managers, no layers between you and the work."

This is better. Specific and different. The "no layers" message resonates with me because I have experienced the alternative.

> Stats: 5 Engineers, 30+ Years, 0 Project Managers, 100% Your IP

The "0 Project Managers" as a stat is clever positioning. But the math on "30+ years" is concerning. That is 6 years average per engineer. I would not call that "senior."

### Values Section

> "Direct Access - Talk to engineers, not account managers"

Good. This is what I want.

> "Fixed Pricing - We absorb overruns, not you"

Good in theory. But I have seen fixed-price projects turn adversarial when scope creeps. Need to understand their change order process.

> "Full Ownership - Your IP from day one"

Standard for consultancies, but good to state explicitly.

> "In-House Lab - Prototype to test in days"

Interesting. Need to understand actual turnaround times.

### Lab Section

> "We do everything in-house: board assembly, functional testing, EMC pre-compliance, environmental stress screening."

This is valuable. Being able to iterate quickly on hardware is a real advantage.

> Equipment list: Oscilloscopes 8 GHz, Spectrum Analyzers 6 GHz, EMC Test Equipment, Thermal Chamber, SMT Line

Solid equipment for a small lab. The EMC gear is particularly relevant for medical devices. But "EMC pre-compliance" is not the same as certification. Need to understand what exactly they can test.

### Industries Section

> "Medical devices, industrial equipment, and scientific instruments. Projects where regulatory compliance matters and corners can't be cut."

This is good positioning. They are explicitly targeting regulated industries. But then they need to prove they understand the regulatory requirements - and the page does not do that.

> Distribution: Medical 42%, Industrial 35%, Scientific 23%

What does this represent? Revenue? Project count? Hours? And over what time period? If this is all-time for a 2-year-old company, the absolute numbers might be very small.

### Testimonial Section

> "Crab Labs played a key role in refining and validating our product development. We couldn't have done it without them."
> - Myles Ainley, CEO at Atmos Research & Development

One testimonial is not enough. And this is a generic quote that could apply to any consultancy. "Refining and validating" tells me nothing about what they actually did.

I would want to see:
- 3-5 testimonials from different clients
- At least one from a medical device company
- Specific references to deliverables and outcomes

## Comparison: What Good Medical Device Consultancies Do Differently

Based on my experience evaluating consultancies, here is what I typically see from firms that win medical device work:

1. **Explicit regulatory credentials:** They list FDA submissions supported, certifications held, standards they work to
2. **Team bios:** I can see who I would be working with and verify their experience
3. **Detailed case studies:** Not just outcomes, but process - how they approached design controls, testing, documentation
4. **Quality system visibility:** ISO 13485 certification or equivalent description
5. **Insurance and liability:** Professional liability coverage is mentioned
6. **Reference program:** They offer to connect prospects with past clients
7. **Industry associations:** FDA consultant registration, AAMI membership, etc.

Crab Labs has none of these on their About page.

## Final Assessment

### Would I Trust These People With a Critical Project?

**Not Yet.** I need a conversation first. The positioning is interesting, and the "direct access to engineers" model is appealing. But I cannot make a recommendation to my board based on this page alone.

### What Would Change My Mind?

A 30-minute call where they can:
1. Walk me through a specific medical device project in detail
2. Explain their design control process
3. Tell me who would work on my project and their backgrounds
4. Answer questions about their quality system
5. Provide references I can contact

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Insufficient FDA experience | Medium | High | Detailed references check |
| Capacity constraints | High | Medium | Contractual commitments |
| Key person dependency | High | High | Meet full team, understand backup |
| Quality system gaps | Medium | High | Pre-qualification audit |
| Business continuity | Medium | High | Escrow arrangements for IP |

### Recommendation

**PROCEED WITH CAUTION.** Schedule a discovery call. Use it to assess:
1. Actual depth of medical device experience
2. Who would be assigned to the project
3. Quality system maturity
4. References from medical device clients

If the call goes well, request:
- Capability presentation
- Sample documentation (redacted)
- Two reference contacts
- Site visit to Long Beach lab

Do not commit budget without completing due diligence.

## Appendix: Positive Signals I Did Notice

To be fair, there are things I like about this presentation:

1. **No buzzwords:** They are not claiming AI, IoT, or Industry 4.0 expertise. They describe concrete capabilities.
2. **Honest positioning:** "Projects where regulatory compliance matters and corners can't be cut" suggests they understand the stakes.
3. **Transparent pricing model:** $150/hr is competitive and clearly stated.
4. **In-house lab:** Actual test equipment, not just CAD tools.
5. **Direct booking link:** I can schedule a call without going through sales.
6. **Verifiable address:** They are a real company in a real location.

These are not enough to close a deal, but they are enough to warrant a conversation.
